## Description

The Basketball Scorecard is a web-based application that simplifies the process of live score updates during a basketball match. This interactive platform enables users to begin scorekeeping for a game by initiating the first period. A basketball game consists of four periods, each lasting for 12 minutes. After each period, a break is taken, and the timer restarts only when the next period begins. The Basketball Scorecard offers various features such as score updates, foul tracking, and detailed game analysis, providing instant results after the end of every match along with a comprehensive overview of the game.
